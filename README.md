The Fraud Detection project aimed to develop a robust system for identifying fraudulent transactions within anonymized bank transaction data while preserving customer privacy. The dataset comprised real transactional data from banks, with the format altered to ensure security and confidentiality.

One of the primary challenges encountered in the project was dealing with skewed data, where the number of fraudulent transactions was significantly lower than legitimate ones. Addressing this class imbalance was crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the fraud detection system.
